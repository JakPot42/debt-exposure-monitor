"""claude_lender_extractor.py — Claude reads debt-disclosure filing text
and extracts structured lender/counterparty records.

"Claude extracts, rules decide" -- the doctrine used throughout this
portfolio. Claude never scores risk or decides whether a lender is
concerning; it only pulls names, roles, and instrument types out of
unstructured filing prose. risk_engine.py (deterministic) and the
OFAC/BIS/foreign-state-lender checkers (deterministic fuzzy matching)
make every actual determination.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You extract lender and counterparty identities from SEC filing text \
about debt instruments (credit facilities, bond issuances, term loans, \
syndicated loans). For each distinct lender, underwriter, administrative \
agent, or bond trustee named in the text, output one JSON object.

Rules:
1. Only extract entities the text actually names. Do not infer a lender \
that isn't named (e.g. "a syndicate of banks" with no names given yields \
NO record).
2. "evidence_quote" must be a short, real excerpt from the provided text \
that names this entity -- not a paraphrase.
3. "instrument_type" must be one of: credit_facility, bond, term_loan, \
syndicated_loan, other.
4. "role" must be one of: administrative_agent, lender, underwriter, \
trustee, unspecified.
5. Output strict JSON: a list of objects with keys lender_name, \
instrument_type, role, amount_text (the dollar amount/terms mentioned \
near this lender, or "" if none), evidence_quote. No prose outside the \
JSON array.
