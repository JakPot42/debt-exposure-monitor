"""foreign_state_lender_checker.py — flags lenders that are majority
state-owned or state-controlled by a nation on FriendShore's (P3)
HIGH_RISK_COUNTRIES list.

This is deliberately a DIFFERENT signal than OFAC/BIS screening
(ofac_checker.py, bis_checker.py): most institutions on
config.FOREIGN_STATE_LENDERS are NOT sanctioned (China is not
comprehensively sanctioned the way Russia/Iran/North Korea are), so a
Chinese state policy bank becoming a defense supplier's primary lender
produces zero OFAC/BIS hits. That's exactly the gap this project exists
to close -- the risk "doesn't appear in equity data," and it doesn't
appear in sanctions data either. No network call: the list is small,
curated, and cited (config.py), not downloaded.
